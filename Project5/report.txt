Obstacles Overcame
------------------
Making sure that I have the right behavior for everything because the spec is really specific
Making sure the player inputted trials don't break the game
Counting flowers and bees without double counting anything or counting a flower as a bee etc
Testing the program because the game is hard and thinking of ways errors could occur is difficult for it

Pseudocode
----------
in main:
load words into an array with getWords
if no words are loaded
	return 1
input desired rounds
if desired rounds is negative
	output message
	return 1
repeatedly until playing the desired number of rounds
	print round # and secret word length
	play a round using playOneRound()
	update stats with score from playOneRound()
	print the number of tries taken and stats

in playOneRound:
if parameters are invalid
	return -1
repeatedly:
	create an array to hold the secret word
	copy the secret word into its array
	create an array to hold the trial guess
	prompt user for trial word
	populate trial array
	check that each char in trial is a lowercase char
	if this check fails
		print message
	else
		check that the trial word is in the array of all possible words
		if this check fails
			print message
		else
			For every letter match in trial and the secret word in the same place
				increment flowers
				replace the letter in the trial array with a ' '
				replace the letter in the secret word array with a ' '
			For every remaining letter in trial that matches a remaining letter anywhere in the secret word
				increment bees
				replace the letter in the trial array with a ' '
				replace the letter in the secret word array with a ' '
			increment tries
			if we have the same number of flowers as letters in the secret word
				return the number of tries it took to guess the word
			else
				print the number of flowers and bees
