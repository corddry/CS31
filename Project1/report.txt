In step 5 I input that 0 people were surveyed, but 10 people support impeachment and 10 people oppose impeachment.

The resulting output was "inf% say they support impeachment." and "inf% say they oppose impeachment."



logic_error.cpp is identical to original.cpp with the exception that it multiplies
forImpeachment / numberSurveyed and antiImpeachment / numberSurveyed by 10.0 instead of 100.0

The result is that the program still runs, but outputs percentage values which are a tenth as large as they should be.



compile_error.cpp is identical to original.cpp with the exceptions that it says "i" instead of "int" in line 9,
and lacks a semicolon at the end of line 10.

The result of leaving out the semicolon on line 10 ws an error message in the compiler stating that
a semicolon needs to go before the "int" on the next line.

The result of misspelling "int" created six errors.
One for the undeclared identifier "i" which was "int" misspelled
One for not having a semicolon before numberSurveyed, as it assumes numberSurveyed is supposed to be an identifier
and one for each of the four times numberSurveyed appears in the code because it was never properly introduced.
