Problems overcame:
The part of the project that took me the longest was building the logic that places the input into one of the possible ranges.
This was because I was thinking about trying to find the most efficient way to calculate the fine, but ultimately opted for a series of if statements.
I also spent a lot of time debating whether to put an endl at the end of my last cout, but then I read the FAQ.
Reason:
Test data:							Reason:
Amount Less than 40k 						Check range #1
Amount less than 250k but more than 40k & fake athlete = y	Check range #2 & changing athlete fee
Amount less than 250k but more than 40k & fake athlete = n	Check range #2 & changing athlete fee
Amount more than 250k						Check range #3
Amount equal to 0						Check calculation robustness
Amount exactly 40k						Check logic borders
Amount exactly 250k						Check logic borders
Amount that would return multiple decimal places		Check precision
Negative amount							Check bad input message
No input for defendant						Check bad input message
Something other than y or n					Check bad input message
No input for y or n						Check bad input message
